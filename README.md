### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have previous coding experience through the (near) completion of cs50. I have also taught 7-10 year olds some basic Python over the summer. I have experience in JavaScript (node and with html), Python, C, and C++, but I probably have the most experience in JavaScript.

I am interested in taking this class to hopefully strengthen my knowledge of programming and to develop computational thinking skills.

I am also interested in math and science classes.

I'm currently working on a project that tracks data using a Chrome extension and React Native, with Supabase and (maybe) a Python server which I hope this class will encourage me to complete.
